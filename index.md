# Ctrl-P: Control Pressure

This work was done as part of a research project at the [Harvard Microrobotics Lab](https://www.micro.seas.harvard.edu). Our goal was to build a system capable of smooth control of pressure to drive our custom soft robotic hands.

### Publications using this system:
- "[A Dexterous Soft Robotic Hand for Delicate In-Hand Manipulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9134855)," S. Abondance, C.B. Teeple, and R.J. Wood, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2020
- "[Multi-Segment Soft Robotic Fingers Enable Robust Precision Grasping](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0278364920910465)," C.B. Teeple, T.N. Koutros, M.A. Graule, and R.J. Wood, International Journal of Robotics Research, 2020
- "[Ultragentle Manipulation of Delicate Structures using a Soft Robotic Gripper](https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/4/33/eaax5425)," N.R. Sinatra, C.B. Teeple, D.M. Vogt, K.K. Parker, D.F. Gruber, and R.J. Wood, Science Robotics, 2019 (_uses a version modified for use with water pressure_)
